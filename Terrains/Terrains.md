This directory contains all the terrains that can be chosen to host your enviroment. 
A terrain determines the food, food availability, climate, hence the survival rate of a species.

Eg. A polar bear thrives in very cold climate, but isn't much of a winner in a desert (unless it evolves enough to survive it, which requires a high initial population to offset the depressing mortality rate of polar bears in deserts prior to mutations)

To describe a terrain,

1. State its mean temperature and its variance(+- mean), mean rainfall and its variance.   

2. State the hemisphere of location (North/South)
